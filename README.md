# README #

This application is a very simple example of using the Spring Boot framework
to create an API for a blog.  All examples that I created here I derived after
reading the wonderful "Spring In Action" book by Craig Walls.  I would really
recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Spring.

This API is a very simple blog API.  I usually like to create quick blog
applications when learning something new - I find that it's small enough, yet
contains enough complexity to cover a lot of use cases I may run up against.
In this example, there would be three tables to run the app; Authors,
Articles, and Tags.

* One Author writes many Articles
* One Article belongs to one Author
* Many Tags may belong to many Articles

With this relationship in mind, we can then create a simple RESTful API to
pull and save author & article information.

### How do I get set up? ###

This is a maven project, so all that's needed to build this is run maven with
the target of package.  This will execute all of the included unit tests.  To
run the application, execute the main method in App.java.

Any questions or comments to this project can be submitted as tickets - and I
do welcome feedback on this.
